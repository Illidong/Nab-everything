Added faction "Continent of Pendor". Has 18 cities from the mount and blade: Warband module "prophesy of pendor". Uses Spacedoutchicken's resources from Upside Down and Wakanda.
Added building "found Knighthood orders". Gives everything and is the building you'll probably build first due to it's cost not to mention it's boosts.
Added wonder "number one under heaven competition". Faction ultimate. Comes with a free unit plus golden age to boost your troops. Has amazing synergy with Autocracy completed and its recommended that you time policy and wonder to finish at roughly the same time to receive the certain bonuses, so you can finally deliver the coup de gr√¢ce to your enemies right after. Freedom is also good but Autocracy gives much better power. Though Freedom completed bonus can be depended on for much longer fights and campaigns and is more permanent than the autocratic one which only lasts for 50 turns.
