Added faction "Continent of Pendor". Has 18 cities from the mount and blade: Warband module "prophesy of pendor". Uses Spacedoutchicken's resources from Upside Down and Wakanda.
Added building "found Knighthood orders". Gives everything and is the only building you'll ever need.
Added wonder "number one under heaven". Faction ultimate. Comes with a free unit plus golden age to boost your troops. Has amazing synergy with Autocracy(completed) and I recommended to time both their completion at same time in order to deliver the finishing blow to your enemies. 
Added unit "Order Grandmasters", the unique unit that comes with the faction wonder. Has amazing stats and its only weakness is inability to capture cities.
Added unit "Foot knights and sergeants", factional infantry, great in battles, but works even greater when used to capture cities.
Added unit "Heavy knights and sergeants", factional cavalry, use them to destroy weakened enemies. Works exceptionally well with the Mounted ranges and sergeants.
Added unit "Mounted Rangers and sergeants", factional mounted ranged skirmishers, fast, mobile, and scary, they would do well with their heavy counterparts, both have same max movement points so they can assist each other. The rangers wound the enemy and the heavies finish them off.
Added tile improvement "Order Stronghold". The ultimate improvement, gives everything, can be built everywhere except for resource tiles and even has defensive uses.
