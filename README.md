Added building "found Knighthood orders". Gives everything and is the building you'll probably build first due to it's cost not to mention it's boosts.
Added wonder "number one under heaven". Faction ultimate. Comes with a free unit plus golden age to boost your troops. Has amazing synergy with Autocracy(completed) and it recommended that you time both to finish at same time, and todeliver the coup'de grace to your enemies right after.
Added unit "Order Grandmasters", the unique unit that comes with the faction wonder. Has amazing stats and its only weakness is inability to capture cities.
Added unit "Foot knights and sergeants", factional infantry, great in battles, but works even greater when used to capture cities.
Added unit "Heavy knights and sergeants", factional cavalry, use them to destroy weakened enemies. Works exceptionally well with the Mounted ranges and sergeants.
Added unit "Mounted Rangers and sergeants", factional mounted ranged skirmishers, fast, mobile, and very scary. They do well with their heavy counterparts, for both have same max movement points and the rangers will wound the enemies so the heavies can finish them off.
Added tile improvement "Order Stronghold". The ultimate improvement, gives everything, can be built everywhere except for resource tiles and even has defensive bonuses.
